		<h2><em>for practicing HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (eventually)</em></h2>
		
		<h3>Our first Paragraph</h3>
			<p> <strong>This</strong> is <em>our</em> first paragraph. Congratulations!<br>
			Just for the sake of making this an actual paragraph,<br>
			allow me to ramble on for a moment about how this is <br>
			our first paragraph and we should feel good about that.<br>
			Maybe I could mention how I have no idea what I'm doing,<br>
			but I'm learning even if it is at a snails pace! <br>
			There we have it, our first paragraph.</p>
		
		<h3>Our first unordered list (bullet points)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Such as list item one.</li>
				<li>Item two.</li>
				<li>And item three!</li>				
			</ul>
		
		<h3>Our first ordered list (numbered)</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Such as list item one, literally.</li>
				<li>Item two. </li>
				<li>And who could forget, item three!</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>CSS comes into play</h3>
		<h4>Before I made this section, the entire page was black and white only with basic text</h4>
		<p>Firstly, I wanted to change the background color of the page from white to something else.<br>
		So we did that, as with all other stylization, in the style tag area.<br>
		Next, I wanted to change header colors. Sure, the page will look like poop, but<br>
		I'm not trying to make this look good. I'm trying to practice coding so in that regard <br>
		I think it's working out alright.</p>
		
		<h3>A screenshot of the website after it's first CSS stylization attempt</h3>
